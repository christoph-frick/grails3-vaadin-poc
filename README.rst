Grails3 + Vaadin
================

This is a proof of concept, to work with Vaadin directly in Grails 3 --
without the need for a plugin (but this configs could be turned into a
plugin).

All the changes are copied over from my `Spring Boot Groovy Vaadin Starter
<https://github.com/christoph-frick/springboot-groovy-vaadin-starter>`_

This by default uses a widgetset and a theme.
